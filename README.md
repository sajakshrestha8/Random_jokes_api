<h1>Random Jokes API</h1>
It is a project that provides three API for the random jokes where
1. One API provides all the Jokes stored
2. Second API provide single joke at a time randomly
3. Last API can be used to add the jokes in the storage

<h2>Swagger UI</h2>
- I used Swagger UI in my project to provide a API documentation which may help other developers to access my API easily without any issue regading the API 

You can access the Swagger UI docs on the URL below after stating the server
- localhost:8000/docs

<h2>Vercel</h2>
- I used vercel to deploy the nodeJS project.
You can explore the deployed version using three different routes

1. https://random-joke-api-liart.vercel.app/jokes-
     Access all the jokes that are stored in the server

2. https://random-joke-api-liart.vercel.app/joke-
     Access single joke at a single refresh

<h2>EJS</h2>
I have implemented EJS(Embedded javascript) for the User Interface 
  ESJ is used in this project because EJS allows you to generate dynamic HTML content by embedding JavaScript code within your HTML templates.
